A couple weeks ago, I was doing the dishes. There were just a couple things that wouldn’t fit in the dishwasher so I was washing them by hand. The last thing was a glass cup. I don’t know what happened - maybe I’m going crazy, I’d checked the water temperature and all - but as far as I can tell it shattered in my hand. I had to yell for my husband to come help bandage me up because that much blood would have me on the floor in a few seconds. He was thankfully in hearing distance and came running. I sat down at the island and he got me paper towels til the bleeding stopped and he was able to apply antibiotic and bandaids. We replace them a few times a day for about a week and I was finally able to look at it without getting woosie. 


Update: I have some awesome scars but they healed up pretty well.
