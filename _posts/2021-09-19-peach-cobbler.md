I had a delicious Peach Cobbler at a girls’ camp and had to get the recipe. That was so long ago though and I don't have that recipe anymore but I found that it was equivalent to what is called a dump cake and is everywhere online just cooked in a dutch oven. Since I'm not likely to make it while camping, I need an oven version anyway. I tried a couple recipes online and adapted them to a perfectly delicious version. I got some fresh peaches one day and had to compare it to the canned version. I would say the canned is certainly easier but having peach puree instead of peach water/syrup from the can makes a big difference. If you just want to use canned peaches anyway, I might try using two cans, drain the juice and blend up 1/2 - 2/3 of one can for the puree. This is a small batch because it is certainly best fresh and we usually only need a few servings. It serves 4-6. I put this in a small snapware pan to bake. If you need more, a triple batch will fit well in a 9x13 pan. 

6 Fresh Peaches  
1 TBSP water  
Dash of cinnamon  
1/2 tsp vanilla  
1/4 C Brown sugar  
3 TBSP Butter  
1/3 Cake Mix ([Recipe Here](../2023-07-26-homemade-cake-mix.md))

Cut up peaches, peel if desired. Dump 4 peaches worth into pan.  
Put the other 2 plus the water into a blender and blend til there are no chunks. Run through a fine mesh strainer, stir in the vanilla and cinnamon and then mix into the peaches in the pan.  
Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the cake mix and brown sugar until only very small pieces remain visible.  
Spread mixture evenly over the top of the peaches.  
Bake at 375 F for 35 minutes.

Cool slightly. Serve with vanilla ice cream.
