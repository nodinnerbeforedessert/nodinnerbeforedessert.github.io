My dad had another name for these (maggot omlet) but that sounds gross so we changed it to “Mega”. This is a super quick and easy meal that brings the salty tastiness of ramen to a nutrition egg. 

Top Ramen<br> 
Eggs<br>
Milk (optional)<br>
Cheddar<br>

Cook the ramen according to package instructions, drain. Beat eggs (and milk if using), then mix in the noodles.  

Preheat pan (my mom always used an electric skillet but I don’t have one). On medium low, add the mixture and cover with the lid. 

Let cook on one side for a few minutes then when it seems ready (cooked egg poking up the sides), flip it over and cover again. Flip once more when the other side seems done. Lower heat, top with cheese and cover til the cheese melts.

Serve with ketchup, soy sauce, or tabasco.
