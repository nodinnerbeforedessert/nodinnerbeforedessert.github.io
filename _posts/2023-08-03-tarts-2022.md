Pumpkin Tart  
I turned [this recipe](https://lilluna.com/pumpkin-delight-dessert/) into a tart. Spread a layer of the cream cheese frosting on the bottom, fill the rest with the pumpkin pudding and top with whipped cream.  

S'mores Tart  
Spread a layer of ganache on the bottom. I found this [Ganache article](https://www.sallysbakingaddiction.com/chocolate-ganache/) helpful in determining how thick/thin to make the chocolate. You can stir in some cinnamon to add a little bit more graham cracker-iness to it.
Top with [Marshmellow Creme](https://www.sallysbakingaddiction.com/homemade-marshmallow-creme/) spread to the edges to seal in the ganache. Try to make a nice swirl pattern on top and then torch it.
