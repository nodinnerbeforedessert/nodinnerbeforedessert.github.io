Just for the fun of it, I read the back of a cake mix box and tried to put a mix together. This came in handy when celiac entered my life and I could use gluten free flour. This mix is great for cake but also anywhere a cake mix is used - like this [Peach Cobbler](../peach-cobbler). 

1 tsp salt<br>
8 g = 1 tbsp corn starch<br>
12 g = 1 tbsp baking powder<br>
18 g = 2 tbsp milk powder<br>
220 g = 1 1/2 C flour (or gluten free flour)<br>
150 g sugar 

If you are actually turning it into a cake, add:<br>
1 tbsp corn syrup<br>
1 tsp vanilla<br>
3 eggs<br>
1/2 C oil<br>
1 C water<br>

For chocolate cake, replace 1/4 C flour with 1/3 C cocoa.
