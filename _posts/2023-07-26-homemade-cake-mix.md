Just for the fun of it, I read the back of a cake mix box and tried to put a mix together. This came in handy when celiac entered my life and I could use gluten free flour. This mix is great for cake but also anywhere a cake mix is used - like this [Peach Cobbler](2021-09-19-peach-cobbler.md). 

1 tsp salt  
8 g = 1 tbsp corn starch  
12 g = 1 tbsp baking powder  
18 g = 2 tbsp milk powder  
220 g = 1 1/2 C flour (or gluten free flour)  
150 g sugar 

If you are actually turning it into a cake, add:  
1 tbsp corn syrup  
1 tsp vanilla  
3 eggs  
1/2 C oil  
1 C water  


For chocolate cake, replace 1/4 C flour with 1/3 C cocoa.
