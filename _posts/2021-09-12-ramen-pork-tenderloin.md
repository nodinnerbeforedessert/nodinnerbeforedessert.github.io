Pat Pork Tenderloin dry with paper towel. Crush Chicken Boullion into powder with other seasonings? with a mortar and pestle. Rub boullion powder all over the tenderloin. 

Heat a pan over medium high heat. Add honey and soy sauce to pan. Once boiling, put the tenderloin in the pan and “sear” on all sides or should it really sear and add the honey and soy sauce after?
