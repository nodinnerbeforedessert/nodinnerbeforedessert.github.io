I had two sisters over to cook with me as a bonding activity. Since I don’t live at home anymore I feel like I don’t know them sometimes. I let them pick what to make if there was something they wanted to try. So my husband took us all out for breakfast and then went shopping for the groceries we needed and we made lunch and dinner.

We made ramen (see my pork recipe) with homemade chicken stock 
cream cheese wontons
Spring rolls from a Chinese cookbook
