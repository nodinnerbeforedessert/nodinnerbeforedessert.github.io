Most keto fat bombs are cream cheese, but I get tired of dairy sometimes so I tried something new.<br>

Ingredients:<br>
3-4 C fresh or frozen strawberries<br>
Lemon juice<br>
1/2 C cocoa butter wafers<br>

Put the strawberries in a medium saucepan. Add a few splashes of lemon juice. It's like making strawberry jam, just skip the sugar! Simmer until the mixture gets pretty thick. <br>

Melt the cocoa butter and add the strawberry mixture and mix until mostly mostly smooth.<br>

Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper and spread the mixture over it and put it in the freezer for a couple hours. Then break it up roughly like peanut brittle. Put it all in a container and store in the freezer for whenever you need a tasty snack.
