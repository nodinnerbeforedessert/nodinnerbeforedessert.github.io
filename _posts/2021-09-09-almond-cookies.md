Unless you are from or have a connection to Scandinavia, you probably haven’t heard of kransekake. It’s a little tricky to get the layers perfectly round, even with a special pan that is specifically made for this cake. 

One day I had a little extra dough at the end of making it so I turned it into these sliced cookies and they have been a hit with everyone who has tried them. Plus they’re naturally gluten free!

3 Egg whites<br>
1 lb Powdered sugar<br>
1 lb Almond Flour<br>

In a medium bowl, mix sugar and almond flour.  

Add egg whites and gradually work in the almond sugar. It may seem impossible but all of the the powder will be incorporated into the egg.

Roll into a log and cut into 1/2-3/4” rounds. Place on baking sheet and bake at 350 F for 10-12 minutes

For the traditional frosting:<br>
Powdered sugar to reach a good consistency<br>
Egg white (pasturized if that freaks you out)<br>

Mix ingredients and frost the cookies.

(or use leftover butter cream frosting from a cake as in the picture above)
