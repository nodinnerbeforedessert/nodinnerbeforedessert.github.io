Unless you are from or have a connection to Scandinavia, you probably haven’t seen this cake. It’s called Kransekake which my brother in law turned into kraken cake. It’s a little tricky to get the layers perfectly round, even with this special pan that is specifically made for this cake. 

One day I had a little extra dough at the end of making it so I turned it into these sliced cookies and actually haven’t made the cake since (except to take the picture above). These cookies are a hit with everyone who has tried them and they’re gluten free so my mother-in-law can eat them too. 


Egg white  
Powdered sugar  
Almond Flour  

In a medium bowl, mix sugar and almond flour.  
Add egg whites and gradually work in the almond sugar. It may seem impossible but all of the the powder will be incorporated into the egg.

Roll into a log and cut into 1/2-3/4” rounds. Place on baking sheet and bake at 350? for 10? minutes

For the frosting:
Powdered sugar  
Egg white (pasturized if that freaks you out)  

Mix ingredients and frost the cookies.
