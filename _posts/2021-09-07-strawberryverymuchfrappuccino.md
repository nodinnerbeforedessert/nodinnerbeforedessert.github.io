More than likely, you havenâ€™t heard of this. It was only available at Starbucks in Japan for one month in 2019. I found it my first day of that trip and had at least one every day (I was there for 10 days). I tried the white once but then went back to the red. When I left Japan, I knew I would have to figure out how to make it at home. I tried and I was liking the results except I only had a Magic Bullet to work with and it would leave large chunks of ice. After getting a Vitamix and finally getting over my fear of it, I had to look into this again. Check out [this post](2021_10_19_StrawberrySauceBattle.md) where I experimented with variations. 

Strawberry Sauce
- Strawberries - hulled and diced
- Sugar
- Vanilla

Frappuccino Mix
- Strawberry sauce
- Ice

Toppings
- Whipped cream
- Freeze dried strawberries - crushed

To make the strawberry sauce, place all ingredients in sauce pan and cook until strawberries are soft and sauce is thickened. (or follow any strawberry sauce recipe you like).

Assembly:

1. Drop a dollup of whipped cream and strawberry sauce in a clear cup to decorate the sides.

2. Blend frappuccino mix and pour into the cup.

3. Top with more whipped cream and crushed freeze dried strawberries or just more strawberry sauce.
