More than likely, you havenâ€™t heard of this. It was only available at Starbucks in Japan for one month in 2019. [Here's the proof!](https://www.moshimoshi-nippon.jp/194718/amp). I found it my first day of that trip and had at least one every day (I was there for 10 days). I tried the "white" once but then went back to the red. When I left Japan, I knew I would have to figure out how to make it at home. I tried and I was liking the results except I only had a Magic Bullet to work with and it would leave large chunks of ice. After getting a Vitamix and finally getting over my fear of it (the Vitamix), I had to look into this again. Check out [this post](../StrawberrySauceBattle) where I experimented with variations for the base. [This was my favorite from Allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/43914/supreme-strawberry-topping/)

Strawberry sauce  
Ice  
Whipped cream  
Freeze dried strawberries, crushed (optional)  

Make the strawberry sauce and allow to cool.  
Blend strawberry sauce and ice until smooth.  
Drop a dollup of whipped cream and strawberry sauce in a clear cup to decorate the sides.  
Fill cup with strawberry mix from the blender  
Top with more whipped cream and crushed freeze dried strawberries or just more strawberry sauce.
