I was inspired by this recipe which was quite tasty. I’d made another keto ice cream at the beginning of my keto journey but keto ice cream gets so hard and I was struggling to get through it. Then I decided to try combining the ideas into a milkshake.
This milkshake was an amazing treat when I was doing keto and of course it’s still good with normal ice cream too.  

Vanilla Ice Cream
Frozen strawberries
Milk (or almond/coconut milk)
Cream cheese

Blend ingredients and top with cookie crumbs (try this recipe for the keto option) and/or whipped cream.
