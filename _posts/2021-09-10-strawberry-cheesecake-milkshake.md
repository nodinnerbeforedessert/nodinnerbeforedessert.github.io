I was inspired by [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV42_G65T7c&t=113s) which was quite tasty. I’d made another keto ice cream at the beginning of my keto journey but keto ice cream gets so hard and I was struggling to get through it. Then I decided to try combining the ideas into a milkshake.
This milkshake was an amazing treat when I was doing keto and of course it’s still good with normal ice cream too.  

Vanilla Ice Cream
Frozen strawberries
Milk (or almond/coconut milk)
Cream cheese

Blend ingredients and top with cookie crumbs (try [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK03OkDhps0&t=0s) for the keto option) and/or whipped cream.
