I never measure this one and may forget something occasionally so it comes out different every time. The amount of everything depends on the size of the tomato sauce can. If you didnâ€™t get enough in at the beginning you can add more later.

Olive oil<br>
Garlic (if desired)<br>
Oregano<br>
Parsley<br>
Basil<br>
Bay leaf<br> 
Onion powder<br>
Salt<br>
Pepper<br>
Red pepper flakes<br>
Tomato sauce (or tomato paste + equal part water)<br>

Start the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Once hot, add all herbs and seasonings except the bay leaf. Heat for 30-60 seconds til aromatic. Pour in Tomato sauce. Stir in seasoning and bay leaf. Let flavors mix for as long as you have time for but at least 5 minutes. Cover pan to avoid splattering.
