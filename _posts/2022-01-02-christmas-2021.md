Christmas has come and gone again! I came up with a rather ambitious plan just before Thanksgiving (other ideas were not working out in my tests). This plan was to use another thing I had bought (again inspired by Preppy Kitchen) with grand ideas but hadn't yet used: a tart ring.  

I used John's tart dough recipe and parts of the fillings but I didn't make any of them exactly as he does. I decided on 12 flavors I wanted to try though I only got around to making 11 of them:

Pecan (tested for Thanksgiving)<br>
Blackberry/Chocolate<br>
Citrus (Grapefruit, Lemon and Orange)<br>
Cheesecake with blueberry compote<br>
Hazelnut/Nutella<br>
Pistachio<br>
Peanut Butter<br>
Pomegranate<br>
Butterscotch<br>
Apple<br>
Key Lime Pie (added for my family's box)<br>

Here are the ["recipes"](../tarts-2021) for those.

The first ten I made in a frenzy over Thanksgiving weekend and took in to work on a day we luckily had a company wide meeting so I had lots of taste testers.  
The next week or two I made some more and delivered to friends and Michael's family.  
Then on Christmas Eve, I finished up a batch to take for my family the next day.  

Every flavor had fans and funnily enough I still haven't tried them all! It was a lot of work but also a lot of fun. 

I bought a bunch more tart rings after the first round because it took so long to make them three at a time. 

Here's a picture of the other box:
