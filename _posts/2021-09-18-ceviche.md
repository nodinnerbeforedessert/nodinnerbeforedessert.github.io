A friend taught me how to make this several years ago. Unfortunately I didn’t take any pictures and I haven’t made it in so long, I had to rediscover and retest this recipe. 

Limes<br>
Onion<br>
Bell Pepper<br>
Chili Pepper?<br>
Cilantro <br>
Salmon<br>
Olive oil<br>

Tomatoes<br>
Avocado<br>


Cut the veggies and salmon. Juice the limes. Mix in bowl. Let sit for at least half an hour and eat with tortilla chips.
