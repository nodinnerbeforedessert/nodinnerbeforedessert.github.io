A friend taught me how to make this several years ago. Unfortunately I didn’t take any pictures and I haven’t made it in so long, I had to rediscover and retest this recipe. 

Limes
Onion
Bell Pepper
Chili Pepper?
Cilantro 
Salmon
Olive oil

Tomatoes
Avocado


Cut the veggies and salmon. Juice the limes. Mix in bowl. Let sit for at least half an hour and eat with tortilla chips.
