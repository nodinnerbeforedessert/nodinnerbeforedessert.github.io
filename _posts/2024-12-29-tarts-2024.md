I made four new flavors this year:<br>

**Black Forest**

[Chocolate Cake](https://bakerbynature.com/mile-high-black-forest-cake/#wprm-recipe-container-54141) - I made a half batch of the cake and baked it in 3" ramekins.<br> 
[Candied cherries](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/diy-candied-cherries-recipe)<br>
Whipped cream<br>

Dip the rim of the tart shell in ganache (made for the Grasshopper Tart).<br>
Cut the cake in half and slice each half into 1/4"-ish pieces. Trim the sides so they fit in the tart shell.<br>
Brush the cherry sauce on each slice of cake, place a few cherry pieces on each and pipe whipped cream to hold them in place.<br>
Stack the slices two high and transfer to the tart shells.<br>
Fill in with extra cherries, whipped cream and cake scraps.


**Grasshopper**

[Mint Buttercream](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/classic-mint-chocolate-brownies/) - I used "MINT" extract since I associate this flavor with green and peppermint with red.<br>
[Ganache](https://www.sallysbakingaddiction.com/chocolate-ganache/)<br>
Whipped Cream<br>
Andes Mints<br>

Spread a layer of mint buttercream in the shells and top with ganache. <br>
Add a small peak of whipped cream and stick in an Andes Mint (make sure the word is the right way up!).

**Banana Cream**

[Pastry cream](https://www.preppykitchen.com/vanilla-custard/) <br>
Bananas<br>
Whipped Cream<br>

Slice the bananas and fit into tart shells. Fill the bottom as well as possible - cutting slices in half too.<br>
Cover with pastry cream - spread into the gaps between bananas and smoothe the top.<br>
Top with a banana shape of whipped cream.


**Peppermint Cheesecake**

In case this disappears, I copied the [recipe](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=122120204834395159&id=61561854786815&set=a.122098312658395159) here:<br>
8 oz Cream Cheese, softened<br>
1/2 C powdered sugar<br>
1 tsp peppermint extract<br>
1 C heavy whipping cream, whipped to stiff peaks + more for topping<br>
Crushed candy canes<br>

Beat the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and peppermint extract. Mix in the whipped cream. Fill tart shells.<br>
Pipe a large peak of whipped cream on top and sprinkle with crushed candy canes.
