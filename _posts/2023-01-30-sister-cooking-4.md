I had the sisters over again and made [Katsudon](https://cookingwithdog.com/recipes/katsudon/). My sisters brought an air-fryer with them for us to try so we used this [Pork Cutlet](https://cookthestory.com/air-fryer-pork-cutlets/) recipe to go with it. I just had to adjust it slightly to make it gluten free.

And for dessert, we made krumkake. We followed the recipe (except using Gluten free flour) that came with the [krumkake pan](https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-Norwegian-Krumkake-Iron/dp/B00004RFPK/). We ate them like ice cream cones.
