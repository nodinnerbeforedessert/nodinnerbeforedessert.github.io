Having tried and liked rose flavored ice cream I was excited to try another flower flavor even with the risk of it tasting like laundry (at least it would be clean laundry!). Here we’ll make the same creme anglaise ice cream base but steep the dried lavender in the warming milk/cream and remove them before moving on. I’ll have to test how much dried lavender to use…

Ice cream ingredients<br>
Dried Lavender<br>

Steep the lavender in the warm milk for some amount of time. Remove, then continue with the ice cream recipe - skipping vanilla or any other flavorings. Refrigerate base before freeze churning.
