I had some leftover turkey gravy from Thanksgiving and a good bit of rotisserie chicken in my freezer. So I made up a casserole to get that out of the way. I kinda made it up as I went so I don't have measurements...    

Olive Oil<br>
Carrots, diced<br>
Onion, diced<br>
Wild Rice Blend<br>
Turkey or Chicken<br>
Turkey Gravy<br>
Bouillion (optional - if needed or desired for more flavor)<br>
Chicken Stock (optional - if needed)<br>
1 TBSP evaporated milk (optional)

Bread Crumbs (panko)<br>
Butter or olive oil<br>

Saute onion and carrot for a couple minutes. Add rice and mix of gravy, bouillion + water or chicken stock as needed to have a bit more than the right amount of liquid per package instructions and flavor as desired. Cook rice for the amount of time noted on the package. Taste test if needed.  
Cut the meat into bite sized pieces. Stir into the rice. Pour mixture into oven safe pan.  
Mix bread crumbs and melted butter, spread over rice mixture and broil til golden brown.
