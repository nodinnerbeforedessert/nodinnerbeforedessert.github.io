This was occasionally our dinner. A super easy sandwich. The only way to mess it up is to burn it in the broiler which happened more often than youâ€™d think. We would always make a pair with crunchy peanut butter for my dad. 

Bread
Peanut Butter (whatever kind you like)
Marshmallows (preferably mini)

Preheat the broiler. This is the best way to not forget them. When it takes too long to toast the marshmallows is when they burn!
Spread peanut butter on the bread slices as for a sandwich. Top with as many marshmallows as will fit - tear large marshmallows in half - then slide into the broiler.
Watch closely til the marshmallows turn golden on top.
