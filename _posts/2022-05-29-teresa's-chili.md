I rented a basement for a year and a half before I got married. Occasionally, the homeowners would ask if I'd eaten and wanted some food. One such meal was chili. I have always liked my mom's chili recipe and seeing the chunky bean filled chili I was a little worried but one spoonful was enough to convince me that I needed the recipe.

1 medium onion  
1 bell pepper  
Mushrooms (ok I skip this)  
Italian sausage 70:30 (meat:fat)  

1 can red kidney beans (drained and rinsed)  
1 can black beans (drained and rinsed)  
1 can garbanzo beans/chickpeas (drained and rinsed)  
1 can pinto beans (drained and rinsed)  

1 can stewed tomatoes  
2 cans tomato sauce  
1 can tomato paste  

Italian seasoning

Cut the onion and pepper and throw the mushrooms straight in the garbage (or skip buying them).  
Cook the sausage as you would ground beef. Add the onions and pepper and cook until onions are translucent and peppers soften slightly but still have a crunch. Add beans, tomatoes and sauces and a good bit of italian seasoning to the pot and cook until hot through. 

Serve with chips, cheese, sour cream or whatever you like with chili.
