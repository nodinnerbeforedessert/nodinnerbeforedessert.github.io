I made this tart for my work Christmas party 2025.<br>


Make the tart shells according to the direction [in this recipe](https://preppykitchen.com/chocolate-tart/)
To make them gluten free, make a slight adjustment to the ingredient list:<br>
160 g confectioners sugar<br>
2 Large Eggs <br>
2 Large Egg Yolks<br>
1 tsp vanilla paste (not extract)<br>
1 lb plain flour 450g (Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1:1 Baking Flour works great)<br>
1 cup unsalted butter cold & cubed<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
(this typically makes 24 shells)<br>

Make [lemon butter cream frosting](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-buttercream-frosting/)(a 1/2 batch was slightly more than needed.)<br>
Using a small offset spatula, spread frosting around the inside of the baked and cooled tart. This is to seal the shell from the custard filling that would otherwise make it soggy. Put the frosted tarts in the fridge to cool while making the next part, so the buttercream frosting can withstand the warm filling.<br>

After the 15 minutes of cooling in this recipe, strain it into a bowl and after stirring for a few minutes, scoop it into the tart shells - fill to be level with the top of the shell - and return the tray to the fridge for 2 hours as the recipe says. <br>
(This batch was enough to fill 19 tarts)<br>

Make whipped cream:<br>
1/2 C heavy cream<br>
~1/4 C powdered sugar<br>
~1/4 tsp vanilla<br>
(this was way more than needed)<br>
Put little dollups on one side and sprinkle with tiny shavings of lemon zest. <br>
