I made this tart for my work Christmas party 2025.<br>

I used my typical [tart crust](https://preppykitchen.com/chocolate-tart/) adapted to be gluten free:<br>
160 g confectioners sugar<br>
2 Large Eggs <br>
2 Large Egg Yolks<br>
1 tsp vanilla paste (not extract)<br>
1 lb plain flour 450g (I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1:1 Baking Flour)<br>
1 cup unsalted butter cold & cubed<br>
1/4 tsp salt<br>
(this typically makes 24 shells)

I used this recipe for [lemon butter cream frosting](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/lemon-buttercream-frosting/)<br>
(I made a 1/2 batch which was still slightly more than needed.) I used a small offset spatula to spread it around the inside of the baked and cooled tart. This is to seal the shell from the custard filling that would otherwise make it soggy. Put the frosted tarts in the fridge to cool, so the buttercream frosting can withstand the warm filling. <br>

I used this recipe for the [lemon custard filling](https://natashaskitchen.com/lemon-posset/)<br>
After the 15 minutes of cooling in this recipe, I strained it into a bowl and after stirring for a few minutes, scooped it into the tart shells and return the tray to the fridge for 2 hours as the recipe said. <br>
(This batch was enough to fill 19 tarts)<br>

Then I made whipped cream:<br>
1/2 C heavy cream<br>
~1/4 C powdered sugar<br>
~1/4 tsp vanilla<br>
(this was way more than needed)
and put little dollups on one side and sprinkled with tiny shavings of lemon zest. <br>
