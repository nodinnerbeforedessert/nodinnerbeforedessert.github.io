I tried a keto lemon curd recipe and couldn’t use it all with the keto cake I made it for. It was also super lemony sour so to lighten it up and hopefully stiffen it up for a frosting I tried whipped cream and it worked like a charm. My aunt who still couldn’t taste from having Covid was still able to get a bit of the lemon. And my diabetic grandma and husband enjoyed the cupcakes with me too, as well as everyone else who didn’t necessarily know it was keto. Muahahaha!

Lemon Curd<br>
Heavy Whipping Cream<br>
Sugar or substitute<br>

Allow the curd to get to room temperature, beat with a whisk to soften it up. Whip the cream to stiff-ish peaks with the sugar then gently stir into the curd a little at a time to gradually lighten up the curd.
