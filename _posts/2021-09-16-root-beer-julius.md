Youâ€™ve probably heard of Orange Julius. Dairy Queen has a Julius stand in the food court of the local mall. My family started making these at home over a decade ago and we adjusted it to try every flavor we could think of. Orange Julius recipes use frozen orange juice concentrate but just about any juice or soda is great too. Here I give our recipe for the Root Beer version which tasted a lot like a root beer float. 

Root Beer
Milk
Vanilla
Sugar
Ice

Put everything in a blender (maybe half the ice to start with depending on your blender) and blend til smooth.
