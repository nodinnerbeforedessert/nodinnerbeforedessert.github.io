Youâ€™ve probably heard of Orange Julius (pictured). Dairy Queen has a Julius stand in the food court of the local mall. My family started making these at home over a decade ago and we adjusted it to try every flavor we could think of. Orange Julius recipes use frozen orange juice concentrate but just about any juice or soda is great too. Here I give our recipe for the Root Beer version which tastes a lot like a root beer float. Feel free to try any soda you like and see how it is. Also for any orange julius recipe - just substitute any juice concentrate - though I found lemonade flavor was a little weaker so either increase the amount of concentrate or reduce the milk.

1 can Root Beer  
1 c Milk  
1 tsp Vanilla  
1/4 c Sugar (optional)  
1-3 C Ice (depending on how thick you want it)  

Put everything in a blender. Start with less ice and add more as you like and blend til smooth.
