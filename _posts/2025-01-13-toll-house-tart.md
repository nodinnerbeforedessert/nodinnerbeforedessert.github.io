A friend hosts a pie party and kindly gets some gluten free pie from a bakery. But when I see the other pies she made, I sometimes feel like I'm missing out. Last year she made a Toll House Pie so I decided to turn it into a tart, and GF of course.<br>

I followed [this recipe](https://www.afamilyfeast.com/toll-house-chocolate-chip-pie/) just swapping out the flour for a GF blend. I made a half batch which filled 6 tart shells. I wasn't sure how long to bake them given my smaller shells (which I also filled frozen) or at what tempurature, so it was quite an experiment and will need more testing for better instructions. <br>

The first batch came out fully baked so it was just a cookie in a pie crust. It should be a little gooey I think.<br>

They did come out of the tart shell pretty well though which I was worried about and wonder about how that will go if I bake it less....<br>

Updates to come!<br>
