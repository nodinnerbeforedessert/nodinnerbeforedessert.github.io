A friend hosts a pie party and kindly gets some gluten free pie from a bakery. But when I see the other pies she made, I sometimes feel like I'm missing out. Last year she made a Toll House Pie so I decided to turn it into a tart, and GF of course.<br>

I followed [this recipe](https://www.afamilyfeast.com/toll-house-chocolate-chip-pie/) just swapping out the flour for a GF blend. I made a half batch which filled 6 tart shells. I wasn't sure how long to bake them given my smaller shells (which I also filled frozen) or at what tempurature, so it was quite an experiment and will need more testing for better instructions. <br>

The first batch came out fully baked so it was just a cookie in a pie crust. It should be a little gooey I think.<br>

They did come out of the tart shell pretty well though which I was worried about and wonder about how that will go if I bake it less....<br>

Updates to come!<br>

Update 4-1-25 and it's not an April Fool's joke:

Bake the empty tart shells for 12 minutes (straight from the freezer as usual). Pull them out of the oven and fill with the toll house cookie filling. Continue baking for 20-25 minutes until the cookie isn't just completely gooey and is slightly browned on top. 

Most of the tarts overflowed so maybe 7 tarts would be better. These were still more stuck to the tart rings than usual. I had to use a small piece of acetate to get them to release from the rings. If they didn't overflow, it may still have been needed, but it would have been easier and prettier.
