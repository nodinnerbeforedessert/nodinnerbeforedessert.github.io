I'd had red currants only one time ever so when a co-worker told me that a farmer's market had red currants, I was so excited. It turned out that she got them on the last day of their season so I had to wait another year but I was finally successful in procuring a box of red currants. 

I spent about five hours destemming and sorting the currants (I did find a few bugs and a little spider) - some for eating, some for freezing, some for jam (the less pretty ones).  Wash the currants well and refrigerate. 

That time I had red currants was in Norway and they were served with other fruit like peaches and strawberries with a vanilla sauce on top. Wash and cut the fruit as needed for fruit salad. I would keep the currants separate from the other fruit so you don't end up with a bowl of just currants at the bottom. Then all you need is the vanilla sauce:

Vanilla Sauce:
1 egg
1/4 C sugar
1 tsp corn starch
1 C milk

Beat the egg in a small or medium pan. Add the sugar and corn starch and whisk until smooth. Gradually add in the milk. 
Heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens slightly and reaches ~190 degrees F. You can continue to cook it if you want a thicker sauce but keep whisking.
Allow to cool in a bowl in the fridge or over ice.

Scoop some fruit into a bowl or cup, top with a spoonful of currants and a dollup of sauce.
