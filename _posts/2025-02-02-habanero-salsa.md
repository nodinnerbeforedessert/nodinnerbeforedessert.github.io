My brother got this recipe from some friends. I'm just putting it in a safe place.

5 habaneros (or fewer for less spice)
3 jalapenos (chopped)
1 onion (finely chopped)
1 TBSP sugar
2 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
2 TBSP minced garlic 
1/2 C cilantro (minced)
2 limes juiced
4 medium-large tomatoes (diced)
Sprinkle of oregano (to taste)
1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce
1 bell pepper (chopped) for more pepper crunch (optional)

Blend habaneros with the tomato sauce. Mix all ingredients together. Let sit for 1 hour or overnight to blend the flavors.
