Finally getting around to recording my tart recipes so some of the process may be a bit vague...
([Original Post Here](../christmas-2021))<br>

Pecan Tart  
Spread a thin layer of [whey caramel](https://food52.com/recipes/70610-whey-caramel) in the botom of the tart shell and top with cut outs of [pecan pie filling](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/maple-pecan-tarts/) - just make the filling of a pecan pie but bake it in a pan lined with parchment paper. When it's done and cool, use a cookie cutter about the size of the inside of the tart (~3") and place in the tart shell.  

Blackberry/Chocolate Tart  
This tart was based off a blackberry chocolate cake in [The Chocolate Bible](https://www.amazon.com/Chocolate-Bible-Christian-Teubner/dp/0670873713/). My mom got this book a long time ago and I loved looking at the pictures but we never made anything out of it. I finally made the blackberry slices cake and loved it so much that it instantly came to mind as I brainstormed ideas for tarts.    
Make the sponge cake, blackberry jam, and chocolate cream as directed. Allow everything to cool, whip the cream as directed.  
Spread a layer of jam on the bottom of the tart, top with a cut out circle of cake (~3" trim as needed), another layer of jam to seal the cake inside the tart shell. Top with a nice layer of chocolate whipped cream.  
Use a cheese grater to make shavings of a nice dark chocolate bar. Sprinkle on top along with a fresh, washed and dried blackberry.  

Citrus Tart  
The citrus tart is a bit involved. Make each flavor of curd:  
[Lemon curd](https://www.preppykitchen.com/lemon-curd/)  
Orange curd - same but use orange juice  
Grapefruit curd - it seems the recipe I followed was removed but I think it was a little thinner than the other curds and might have used some lemon juice too but it would probably work to use the same recipe again but use grapefruit juice.  
Whip some cream and gently stir in some orange curd - spoon into small half sphere silicone molds. Allow to freeze. Whip more cream and stir in lemon curd - spoon into 3" diameter half sphere silicone molds but leave out enough space to press a frozen orange half sphere into the center (so it's at the center of the would-be sphere) Freeze again. When those are done, spread a layer of grapefruit curd into the bottom of the tart shell. Unmold the frozen whipped cream curd and place on top. Garnish with [candied citrus peel](https://www.marthastewart.com/313211/candied-citrus-peels)

Cheesecake Tart with Blueberry Compote  
Bake a cheesecake filling in a pan lined with parchment paper. Cut out circles of cooled cheesecake filling and place into tart shells.  
Blueberry compote - I think I used a cookbook recipe for this one. Make a blueberry sauce - a thin jam sort of thing. Put a small spoonful of sauce on top of the cheesecake. This is best if done fresh before eating - the juices run.  

Nutella Tart  
Make a batch of [Nutella Filling](https://www.preppykitchen.com/chocolate-tart/), and use the same/make a batch of the chocolate whipped cream from the blackberry tart (melt chocolate into cream, cool, then whip). 
Spread a layer of Nutella butter cream in the bottom, top with a nice layer of chocolate whipped cream, top with a Ferrero Rocher.

Pistachio Tart  
Make a batch of [Pistachio spread](https://cake-lab.org/pistachio-spread/) and a batch of Pastry Cream. 
Spread a thin layer of Pistachio spread in the bototm of the tart shell, fill most of the rest of the tart with Pastry Cream.  
Chop up some extra pistachios and keep a few whole and garnish the top of the pastry cream along with three dots of chocolate buttercream.  

Peanut Butter Tart  
Make a batch of the peanut butter part of this [Peanut Butter Bar](https://preppykitchen.com/peanut-butter-bars/), cut out circles and slide into the tart shell. Top with whole or half peanuts and melted white chocolate.

Pomegranate Tart  
Make a pomegranate juice jello - collect or buy pomegranate juice and sugar (if needed) add gelatine (with heat and according to package per liquid volume instructions - you want it to be fully solid but not hard) - pour onto a baking sheet (probably lined with parchment paper or plastic wrap) and allow to solidify in the fridge.  
Fill a tart shell with pastry cream. Top with a 3" cutout of jello. In the center, place an invert sugar half-sphere filled with fresh pomegranate seeds - the sugar starts to disolve as it sits. 

Butterscotch Tart  
Make a batch of [this mousse](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/elegant-white-chocolate-mousse/) except use butterscotch chips instead (or maybe I followed that recipe but added some butterscotch too?), and a batch of Butterscotch Haystacks.
Spread a layer of chocolate buttercream in the bottom 1/3 of the tart shell, fill most of the rest of the way with butterscotch mousse. Top with a haystack.

Apple Rose Tart  
Make large (~3") [Apple Roses](https://www.preppykitchen.com/apple-rose-tart) and bake in a pan lined with parchment paper.   
Spread a layer of [whey caramel](https://food52.com/recipes/70610-whey-caramel) in the bottom of the tart shell and then carefully add an apple rose.

Key Lime Pie  
Again, line a pan with parchment paper and make the filling part of this [Key Lime Pie](https://www.preppykitchen.com/key-lime-pie/). Cut out circles and place in the tart shell. Top with a dollup of whipped cream and a lime twist.
