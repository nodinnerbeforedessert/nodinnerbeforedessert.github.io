 As a teenager, I was obsessed with lemons and created this version of the classic. Fair warning, it is quite lemony.

Lemon
Pepper
Chicken breast
Olive oil

Rice or Salad to serve

Slice the lemon into rings so you see the segments. Make them thin (but not paper) so they will cook faster.
Prep the chicken breast as necessary. Salt and pepper as desired
Using a frying pan that comes with a lid, heat the pan until very hot. Add the splash of olive oil and swirl around pan. Add the chicken breast. Sear on each side for two minutes.
Arrange the lemon slices around the sides and top with the lid. Cook chicken flipping half way through for another 10 minutes or so until it reaches 165 degrees in the thickest part of the breast.

Place chicken (sliced if desired) on a bed of rice or greens and top with the lemon slices.
