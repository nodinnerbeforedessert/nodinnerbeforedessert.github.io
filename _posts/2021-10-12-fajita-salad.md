We use this fajita marinade recipe then my husband grills the meat. 

Veggie Mix
Bell peppers
Onion
Chili powder
Cayenne
Cumin
Garlic powder
Oregano
Salt

Slice veggies. Toss with seasonings. In a large pan, saute veggies til cooked but with still the slightest crunch. With a batch of one green and one red pepper and half a large onion this could take 10 minutes so start it soon after the meat goes on the grill.

Other toppings
Sour cream
Cheese
Salsa
Lime juice
Lettuce 

Make a big salad and top it with all the tasty goodness. (Salad form is great for keto! And you can easily serve tortillas for anyone not doing a low carb diet.)
