I had a delicious Peach Cobbler at a girls’ camp and had to get the recipe. That was so long ago though, and I don’t often go camping so I adapted that recipe to home and the oven.

Canned Peaches
Yellow cake mix
Water?
Eggs?
Butter?

Dump peaches into pan - cut smaller if desired. Sprinkle cake mix over the top. Beat together eggs, water and melted butter. Pour on top. Bake covered with foil for 30 minute?
