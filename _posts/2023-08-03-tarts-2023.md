At a neighborhood market in October, I sold S'mores, Choco-Berry (BLackberry/Chocolate tart but with mixed berry jam), Pumpkin and these two new ones:

Baklava 
I tried two versions of this one before hand and the winner went to the market.
The base was: [Honey Butter Cream](https://www.sugarologie.com/recipes/honey-buttercream-recipe#recipe-card) (I also added 2 TBSP of milk to give it more of a whipped butter texture but maybe I just made too small a batch) Or pastry cream 
With [Baklava filling as seen here](https://natashaskitchen.com/baklava-recipe/]) (I tried half pistachios and half walnuts) with cinnamon baked on their own for about an hour. This gave it a dark roast which I was worried about to start with but tasted great in the final product. For the market I only had walnuts and roasted a little lighter. Still excellent but the dark roast definitely had some fans.
Topped with a flag of [phyllo](https://theloopywhisk.com/2022/01/23/gluten-free-filo-pastry/) with butter layered between. I baked them with 4 layers but being homemade they were a good bit thicker than true phyllo. They also separated so I put 2 in each. They were super crispy and added a nice crunch. 

Pina Colada
[Pineapple jam](https://kitchendreaming.com/pineapple-jam#recipe)
[Whipped Coconut Cream](https://www.theendlessmeal.com/how-to-make-vegan-coconut-whipped-cream/)
Mix about 60:40 whipped cream to jam. Scoop into tart shell. Top with [Crystalized Pineapple](https://www.sonshinekitchen.com/crystallized-pineapple-sweet-snack-3-ingredients/)
Also didn't do yet but thinking about adding toasted coconut flakes too.

Change to the s'more tart: I added crushed graham crackers to the ganache! got that hint of cinnamon and less of a feeling of eating a bar of chocolate. Also a 1 fl oz cream to 1 oz couverture was perfect. Let it cool before scooping it and refridgerate before topping with marshmellow creme so it doesn't move around.

Update to the pumpkin tart: 
This [cream cheese frosting recipe](https://handletheheat.com/best-cream-cheese-frosting/) was great but I added an extra cup of powdered sugar to thicken it. Also that other recipe listed in the previous post - just make the pumpkin pudding from it and use only 2 C milk (so it's a little thicker) and I used fresh whipped cream instead of whipped topping. 

The neighborhood market went ok. It was too cold out but at least proved that people would buy the tarts. They're so pretty they can't resist!



For Thanksgiving I'm going to make:
Blackberry Pie
I love this [blackberry pie recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/blackberry_pie/) and had to turn it into a tart. Easy enough - bake the berries without the pie crust. Spoon into tart shell when cool. Then as a topping... powdered sugar? streusel topping? 
Pastry cream below to make it more tart like than pie?
Struessel would still be good...

Maybe pumpkin, pecan, or apple
