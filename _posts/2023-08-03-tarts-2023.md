My plan so far for this year's tart making:

Peaches Cobbler or Peaches and Cream
bake peach cobbler filling til soft
paint tart with white chocolate for waterproofing?
bake cake with peach puree and portion on top?

Blackberry Pie
I love this [blackberry pie recipe](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/blackberry_pie/) and had to turn it into a tart. Easy enough - bake the berries without the pie crust. Spoon into tart shell when cool. Then as a topping... powdered sugar? streusel topping? 

Raspberry Rose - this was the one I had planned in 2021 but didn't get to...
Raspberry jam?
Rose whipped cream?
Rose pastry cream with raspberry streaks?

Chocolate berry?
Mixed berry jam
chocolate mousse?
whipped cream?
Mixed berry jam pastry cream?

Baklava 
I tried two versions of this one: The base was: [Honey Butter Cream](https://www.sugarologie.com/recipes/honey-buttercream-recipe#recipe-card) (I also added 2 TBSP of milk to give it more of a whipped butter texture but maybe I just made too small a batch) Or pastry cream 
With [Baklava filling as seen here](https://natashaskitchen.com/baklava-recipe/]) (I tried half pistachios and half walnuts) baked on their own for about an hour. This gave it a dark roast which I was worried about to start with but tasted great in the final product.
Topped with a flag of [phyllo](https://theloopywhisk.com/2022/01/23/gluten-free-filo-pastry/) with butter layered between. I baked them with 4 layers but being homemade they were a good bit thicker than true phyllo. They also separated so I put 2 in each. They were super crispy and added a nice crunch. 

Pina Colada
[Pineapple jam](https://kitchendreaming.com/pineapple-jam#recipe)
with coconut cream somehow.... whipped- on top? or mixed in? 
cherry, fresh pineapple, candied pineapple on top? umbrellas?
