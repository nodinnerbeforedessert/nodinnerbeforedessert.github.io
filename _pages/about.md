<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>Welcome to my kitchen where we have no dinner before dessert! JK but there is plenty of both. I love trying new recipes and finding winners or trying to recreate dishes I've tried before. I have more plans than time or what our stomachs can take so we share with family and friends, freeze extra and make a crazy show at Christmas just for fun. Join me on my kitchen adventures... and never forget dessert!</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Courtney. I work on the architecture team of a design and build firm. I love cooking of all kinds and that takes up a good bit of the rest of my time (that and cleaning up after). I have no formal food training, but I try to learn from others on the internet and even cooking textbooks. I have always enjoyed cooking and even made every meal and did every dish for my family for an entire summer when I was twelve. </p>

<p>In March of 2021, I decided to try the Keto Diet so some of my recipe posts will be keto related. This was my first experiment with a diet. It went really well -- I didn't have a lot of weight to lose but I felt healthier. My husband is type 1 diabetic so that worked well for him too to keep his blood sugar under control though he didn't join me in the diet completely. I stuck with it for three months and really liked the results, so I will likely do it again.</p>

<p>Cooking has become something of a family hobby. My sisters are also quite into it so they may get to be guest writers one day when I'm ready to tell people that this blog exists.</p>

<p>I decided to start this blog as a place to store my favorite recipes so I can remember which ones I like and how to make the things I created and share those with anyone who happens to find this blog. I do not expect anyone to find this blog let alone to make money but who knows. </p>

<p>My lovely husband helped me get this blog set up. I do have some experience in HTML and this has been a fun way to get to practice coding again. We have been married for just about two years at the time I'm writing this.</p>

<h2>About the Name</h2>
<p>"No dinner before dessert" was a favorite saying in my family growning up. Sometimes it really did go that way but usually my mom was good about having us eat a real dinner first. </p>
